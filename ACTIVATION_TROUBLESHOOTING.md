# 🔧 Commit Genius - Activation Troubleshooting

## 🚨 Problem: Extension Stuck on "Activating"

If your extension shows "Activating..." but never completes, here are the solutions:

## ✅ **SOLUTION 1: Use the Fixed Version**

Install the latest fixed version:

```bash
# Uninstall any previous version
code --uninstall-extension aicommit-publisher.commit-genius

# Install the fixed version
code --install-extension commit-genius-2.5.6-fixed.vsix

# IMPORTANT: Completely restart VS Code (not just reload)
# Close VS Code entirely and reopen it
```

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Axios Import Issue**: The axios library might cause activation delays
2. **Async Blocking**: Complex async operations during activation
3. **UI Calls**: Early UI calls before command registration

### Fixes Applied

1. **Simplified Activation**: Removed blocking operations
2. **Deferred UI**: Moved notifications after command registration  
3. **Error Isolation**: Better error handling to prevent activation failures
4. **Fallback Logic**: Simple commit message generation without network calls

## 🧪 **Test Versions Available**

### 1. **Minimal Version** (`extension-minimal.js`)

- Bare minimum functionality
- Tests basic activation and button clicks
- Use if main version still fails

### 2. **Fixed Version** (`extension-fixed.js`) - **RECOMMENDED**

- Full functionality without network dependencies during activation
- Generates simple commit messages based on file types
- Includes all Git integration features

### 3. **Full Version** (`extension.js`)

- Complete AI functionality with OpenRouter integration
- Use only after confirming activation works

## 🔄 **Step-by-Step Activation Test**

### Step 1: Install Fixed Version

```bash
code --install-extension commit-genius-2.5.6-fixed.vsix
```

### Step 2: Restart VS Code Completely

- Close all VS Code windows
- Reopen VS Code
- Open a Git repository

### Step 3: Check Activation

You should see:

- ✅ "✨ Commit Genius is ready!" message
- ✅ Sparkle button (✨) in Source Control panel
- ✅ No "Activating..." status

### Step 4: Test Functionality

1. Make file changes
2. Click sparkle button
3. Should see: "🤖 Generating AI commit message..."
4. Commit message appears in input box

## 🛠 **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### Check Developer Console

1. Press `F12` → Console tab
2. Look for:
   - ✅ "🚀 Commit Genius FIXED is now active!"
   - ✅ "✅ Commit Genius FIXED activation completed successfully"
   - ❌ Any error messages

### Manual Command Test

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: "Commit Genius: Generate AI Commit Message"
3. Should work even if button doesn't

### Extension Panel Check

1. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search "Commit Genius"
3. Should show "Enabled" status
4. Version should be "2.5.6-fixed"

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior (Fixed Version)**

### ✅ What Works

- [x] Extension activates immediately
- [x] Sparkle button appears in Source Control
- [x] Automatic file staging
- [x] Simple commit message generation
- [x] Git integration
- [x] API key storage (for future AI features)

### 🔄 What's Simplified

- Commit messages are generated based on file types (not AI)
- No network calls during activation
- Faster, more reliable operation

### 🚀 Future Upgrade Path

Once activation is confirmed working:

1. You can add AI functionality back
2. Test with network calls
3. Gradually restore full features

## 📞 **If Still Not Working**

Try these in order:

1. **Complete VS Code Reset**:

   ```bash
   # Close VS Code completely
   # Delete extension cache (optional)
   code --uninstall-extension aicommit-publisher.commit-genius
   # Restart computer (if needed)
   code --install-extension commit-genius-2.5.6-fixed.vsix
   ```

2. **Use Minimal Version**:
   - Change `package.json` main to `"./extension-minimal.js"`
   - Rebuild and test

3. **Check System Requirements**:
   - VS Code version 1.80.0 or higher
   - Git installed and accessible
   - Node.js available (for extension host)

The fixed version should resolve all activation issues! 🎉
