## üîç Troubleshooting

### The sparkle button doesn't appear

**Check these items**:
1. ‚úÖ Commit Genius is installed and enabled
2. ‚úÖ You're in a Git repository
3. ‚úÖ You have staged changes
4. ‚úÖ Source Control panel is open
5. üîÑ Try restarting VS Code

### "API key not configured" error

**Solution**:
1. Get an OpenRouter API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Add it to VS Code settings:
   - **Settings** ‚Üí **Extensions** ‚Üí **Commit Genius** ‚Üí **API Key**
3. Ensure the key starts with `sk-or-v1-`

### "No staged changes found" message

**You need to stage changes first**:
1. Make changes to files
2. Open Source Control panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
3. Click `+` next to files to stage them
4. Files should appear in "Staged Changes" section
5. Now try generating a commit message

### Generated message is generic or unhelpful

**Try these solutions**:
1. **Stage fewer files** - focus on related changes
2. **Use a different AI model** - try DeepSeek or Claude
3. **Make more descriptive changes** - add comments, use clear function names
4. **Break up large changes** - commit smaller, focused changes

### "Rate limit exceeded" error

**You've hit the free tier limit**:
1. **Wait an hour** for limits to reset
2. **Switch to a different free model**
3. **Upgrade to a premium model** for no limits
4. **Reduce usage** - generate fewer messages per hour

### Extension not working after VS Code update

1. **Update Commit Genius** to the latest version
2. **Restart VS Code** completely
3. **Check extension is enabled** in Extensions panel
4. **Reinstall if needed** - uninstall and reinstall

## ‚ö° Performance & Limits

### How fast is message generation?

- **Fastest**: Mistral Small (2-3 seconds)
- **Medium**: Qwen Coder (2-4 seconds)
- **Slower**: DeepSeek Chat (3-5 seconds)
- **Premium**: Claude Sonnet 4 (1-2 seconds)

### Can I generate multiple messages quickly?

**With free models**: Limited by rate limits (10-25/hour)
**With premium models**: No limits, generate as many as needed

### What's the maximum diff size it can handle?

**Technical limits**:
